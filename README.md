It is highly recommended that the game is played in an independent terminal (not in a code editor like vscode).
The game includes ascii art 'images' to enhance gameplay.
IMAGES ARE NOT GRAPHIC.


The game has a friendly helpful menu to guide the user throughout.
The game instructions can be accessed 'in-game' but for convenience, here they are:

INSTRUCTIONS:
    - OBJECTIVE: SURVIVE.
    - A shotgun is loaded with a disclosed number of bullets, some of which will be blanks.
    - Participants are given a set amount of lives (default = 4) to survive.
    - You and 'The Dealer' will take turns shooting.
    - Aim at The Dealer or at yourself - shooting yourself with a blank skips the Dealers turn.
    - Participants are given items to help out. Use them wisely.
    - if you have chosen wrongly, type 'q'/'quit'/'back' to go back.

ITEMS:
    ‚Ä¢ üö¨ = Gives the user an extra life.
    ‚Ä¢ üç∫ = Racks the shotgun and the bullet inside will be discarded.
    ‚Ä¢ üî™ = Shotgun will deal double damage for one turn.
    ‚Ä¢ üîç = User will see what bullet is in the chamber.
    ‚Ä¢ ‚õì = Handcuffs the other person so they miss their next turn.

Good Luck.
